While Shanavas passes, the rest of the group fails, leaving their prospects of college admission uncertain.\r\n\r\nAfter Valthu gets into a scuffle for flirting with a state-level boxer\u2019s girlfriend, Jojo begins researching alternative ways to enter college and discovers that sports quota admissions through boxing tournaments are a viable route. The group decides to pursue boxing and enroll at the local Alappuzha Gymkhana boxing school, under coach Salim. However, Shanavas soon loses interest and quits, while DJ switches to wrestling.\r\n\r\nJojo, Valthu, and Cherthu persist and are later mentored by Antony Joshua, a former student of Salim and a current state-level boxer training for the South Asia Championship. Antony enforces a strict training and diet plan, pushing them to their physical limits.\r\n\r\nTo earn a spot in the Kerala State Amateur Boxing Championship, the trio competes in the Alappuzha District Boxing Selection Championship. There, they qualify alongside three other boxers: Deepak, a self-taught fighter who learned through YouTube; Kiran, a returning participant who failed in the previous year\u2019s tournament; and Christopher.\r\n\r\nAs the newly formed district team prepares for the state-level championship, Jojo develops feelings for Natasha, a fellow boxer from Alappuzha, though she remains uninterested.\r\n\r\nAt the championship venue, Jojo is unexpectedly bumped into a higher weight category due to overeating. The matches begin with a series of setbacks\u2014Christopher loses his bout, followed by Valthu. Cherthu, however, emerges victorious in his round and earns widespread appreciation. Jojo enters the ring with confidence but loses his match. Demoralized by the team\u2019s performance, Kiran hesitates to compete, but with the encouragement of his teammates, he steps into the ring and fights well, though he loses narrowly on points.\r\n\r\nDeepak puts up a strong performance but ultimately walks away mid-match after receiving threats aimed at his teammates and family. This incident pushes Antony\u2014already revealed to be a suspended boxer with a history of violence\u2014to snap and assault the individual who had issued the threats.\r\n\r\nWith the situation escalating, the team withdraws from the tournament during Cherthu\u2019s second-round bout. On their way out, they are ambushed by a group of men, but they successfully defend themselves using their boxing skills.\r\n\r\nBack home in Alappuzha, Natasha unexpectedly confesses her love for Deepak, helping Jojo find closure. Reinvigorated by their experience, the group decides to train harder and return the following year. Jojo takes on the role of team manager, while Shanavas and DJ prepare to join the team.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2883, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"6ff880ff-c2df-4e9c-b727-03b57ae68103": {"node_ids": ["7473af29-d901-4882-b185-ca64d2e47ffc"], "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\visha\\Desktop\\Data Science\\LLM Project\\Data\\AG Plot.txt", "file_name": "AG Plot.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 2897, "creation_date": "2025-04-30", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-30"}}}}
